# My Guessing Game

This guessing game was created when I first started learning python. In fact, I first built this game off a Codecademy exercise, and expanded upon it after the lesson had finished.
Designing this game tested my basic knowledge of loops, if-else statements, utilizing user input, as well as the assignment of variables. 

### How it works

In this game, the user specifies how much they want to bet, then chooses one of two sides to bet on (defined as 1 or 2). 
If they guess correctly, they earn the money they betted. Else, they lose the money they betted.

When I asked a friend to test out my program, I found out that there were a plethora of issues, including negative bets, and other devious inputs that would break my game. As a result,
I had to check inputs to make sure they were valid numbers.

I also added additional conditional statements so that the user has second chances to play the game, in case they made a typo while inputting a bet or guessing a side.
